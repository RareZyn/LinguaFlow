Background Study

Many science and engineering students learn programming (C/C++/Java) but see compilers/interpreters as a “black box.”

They focus on syntax, with limited understanding of tokenization, parsing, semantic analysis, or execution.

LinguaFlow introduces these hidden processes using simple arithmetic-expression examples.

It will shows how natural language becomes tokens → parse tree → interpreted output.

An integrated LLM guides learners by explaining errors and reinforcing understanding of language processing.

Problems
 seeking to allow end users to use more understandable commands which are using our own language rather than the person need to learn the machine language

 Vast vocabulary and words that are synonymous with each other ; this could easily confuse the machine.

  we  aim to create a resolve for this issue by  creating a  Large  Language Models (LLM)  that will  solve the unfamiliar  and synonymous  verbs

  Objective

  To integrate a Large Language Model (LLM) to semantically resolve unfamiliar or synonymous verbs, mapping them to known command actions.

  To design a grammar-based interpreter calculator that can parse and execute user commands expressed in controlled natural language.

  To ensure safe and verified execution, the interpreter only performs actions that are validated and semantically aligned with user intent.
